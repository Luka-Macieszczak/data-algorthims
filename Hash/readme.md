# Hash function library

## Scratch:
- Need to generate arbitrary numbers of hash functions
- Hash functions should take a defined input to a defined output
- If possible, input to output process should be arbitrary, so code will only need to be written once
- Think about passing in domain and range to be generated arbitrarily
- Improve performance in the future
